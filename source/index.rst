Fish Gym
=====================================

(Main purpose)

Fish Gym is a physics-based simulation framework for physical articulated underwater agent 
interaction with fluid. This is the first physics-based environment that support coupled 
interation between agents and fluid in semi-realtime. Fish Gym is integrated into the OpenAI Gym 
interface, enabling the use of existing reinforcement learning and control algorithms to control 
underwater agents to accomplish specific underwater exploration task.

.. warning:: Note this environment is now tested on Ubuntu18.04 and later, not tested on Mac, definitely not work on Windows due to dependency issues.
